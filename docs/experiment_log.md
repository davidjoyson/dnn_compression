## 2026-05-14 — Architecture Overhaul + ECG Experiments

**Commits:** `0fff1ae` Refactor · `6255b14` Soma layer · `ba1446e` use_soma toggle + param-matched MLP · `2177bd0` ECG + compression baselines + auto-logging

### Morning — Codebase Refactor (`0fff1ae`)
- Added 10% validation split and per-epoch val loss tracking to adult, folktables, HAR experiments
- Threaded `fine_tune_epochs` through all `compress_model` calls; exposed as `--fine-tune-epochs` CLI arg
- Removed dead experiments: creditcard, folktables_multistate, wine, occupancy
- Renamed `src/data/` → `src/loaders/` for clarity
- **Added HAR experiment** (UCI wearable sensor activity recognition, 6-class)
- Added `src/reporting/` module: `summary.py`, `utils.py`, `plots.py` for structured CSV/text/plot output

### Midday — DendriticNetwork Architecture (`6255b14`, `ba1446e`)

**`6255b14` — Add soma layer**
- Inserted `Linear + ReLU` soma between branch concatenation and `fc2`
- Collapses each branch's `hidden_per_branch` activations to one signal per branch — more biologically accurate dendritic integration

**`ba1446e` — Param-matched MLP + use_soma toggle**
- `DendriticNetwork`: `use_soma=True` flag; `fc2` input dim adjusts when soma disabled
- `MLPBaseline`: `match_params` kwarg + `param_matched_hidden()` to auto-size hidden layer to match DendriticNetwork param count — ensures fair comparison
- All experiments updated to param-matched MLP
- `evaluate.py`: added `count_params()` utility
- `main.py`: disabled adult/folktables/scaling; `--arch` shows param-matched MLP

### Afternoon/Evening — ECG Compression Experiments (`2177bd0`)

**Dataset:** MIT-BIH ECG, 87,554 train / 21,892 test, 187 features, 5 classes  
**Model:** DendriticNetwork (hidden1=64, hidden2=32, branches=8, hidden_per_branch=8, ~17k params)

Infrastructure added:
- `.npy` caching in `load_ecg.py` — avoids re-parsing 411 MB CSV on each run
- `--seeds` CLI flag for multi-seed averaging
- Auto-logging via `_Tee` class in `main.py` — every run saves `run.log` to its output folder

Compression methods evaluated:

| Method | Description | Fine-tune |
|---|---|---|
| Snowflake (int8) | Per-layer int8, one scale per layer group | 3 epochs |
| Global int8 | Single global scale across all params | 3 epochs |
| Dynamic (int8) | PyTorch `quantize_dynamic` on Linear layers, CPU-only | 0 (none) |
| ~~Pruned 75%~~ | ~~Magnitude pruning, sparse float32+int32 storage~~ | ~~dropped~~ |

**Progressive results (seed=42):**

| Epochs | Uncompressed | Snowflake (4×) | Global int8 (4×) | 3rd Method |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 67.42% | 78.62% (+11.2%) | 75.35% (+7.9%) | Pruned: 82.40% |
| 10 | 92.40% | 91.60% (-0.80%) | 91.78% (-0.62%) | Pruned: 66.31% |
| 20 | 94.91% | 94.05% (-0.85%) | 95.42% (+0.51%) | Pruned: 35.64% |
| 50 ft=1 | 95.78% | 96.13% (+0.35%) | 94.07% (-1.71%) | Pruned: 37.79% |
| 50 ft=3 | 95.78% | 96.13% (+0.35%) | 94.35% (-1.43%) | Pruned: 37.65% → dropped |
| **50 final** | **95.78%** | **96.13% (+0.35%)** | **94.35% (-1.43%)** | **Dynamic: 95.98% (+0.20%)** |

**Final results — 50 epochs, seed=42:**

| Method | Accuracy | Delta | Size (bytes) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Uncompressed (Dendritic) | 95.78% | — | 68,660 | 1× |
| **Snowflake (int8)** | **96.13%** | **+0.35%** | **17,213** | **4×** |
| Dynamic (int8) | 95.98% | +0.20% | 33,158 | ~2× |
| Global int8 | 94.35% | -1.43% | 17,213 | 4× |
| MLP Baseline | 94.91% | — | 68,728 | 1× |
| MLP Compressed | 96.22% | — | 17,190 | 4× |

**Observations:**
1. **Snowflake best overall** — 4× compression, +0.35% accuracy (quantization regularises)
2. **Dynamic int8 accurate but ~2× only** — PyTorch serialisation overhead doubles size vs manual packing
3. **Global int8 degrades at high epochs** — single scale too coarse for a well-trained model
4. **Pruning (75%) dropped** — catastrophic for a ~17k param model; 75% sparsity unrecoverable regardless of fine-tune epochs
5. **Dendritic beats MLP uncompressed** — 95.78% vs 94.91% (+0.87%)

## 2026-05-16 — Int4 Quantization + 3-Seed Evaluation

**Commits:** *(this session)*

### Summary
Fixed `dynamic_model_size_bytes` to report true raw data size (was inflated ~2× by pickle overhead). Ran full 3-seed evaluation (seeds 42, 0, 7) across all active experiments: ablation, component, HAR, ECG.

### Snowflake int4 (4-bit) Quantization

Added per-layer int4 quantization as the 4th compression method:
- **Packing**: values clamped to [-7, 7], offset-encoded (+8 → [1,15] as uint4), packed 2-per-byte
- **Scale**: same per-layer-group scheme as Snowflake int8 (weight+bias share one scale)
- **Storage**: `ceil(n/2)` packed bytes + 4 bytes per layer scale → 8× compression vs float32

**3-seed ECG results (seeds 42, 0, 7 — 50 epochs, fine_tune_epochs=3):**

| Method | Accuracy | ± std | Delta | Size (bytes) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Uncompressed (Dendritic) | 95.97% | ±1.15% | — | 68,660 | 1× |
| **Snowflake (int8)** | **96.58%** | **±0.89%** | **+0.61%** | 17,213 | **4×** |
| Dynamic (int8) | 95.72% | ±1.45% | -0.25% | 17,684 | ~3.9× |
| Global int8 | 95.31% | ±2.63% | -0.65% | 17,213 | 4× |
| **Snowflake (int4)** | **72.30%** | **±13.89%** | **-23.67%** | **8,631** | **8×** |

**Finding: int4 is not viable for ~17k param models.** The 4-bit range (14 representable values) is too narrow for the weight distributions after training. High variance (±13.89%) shows training is unstable — the quantisation grid is coarser than the meaningful weight differences. Conclusion: **8-bit is the minimum precision for models at this scale**.

To make int4 viable would require a significantly larger model (more parameters to absorb quantisation error) or a much larger fine-tuning budget.

### Dynamic Quantization Size Fix

`torch.save` on PackedParams objects adds ~15KB pickle overhead, making dynamic quant appear ~2× instead of ~4×. Fixed by measuring raw data directly:
- int8 weights: `mod.weight().int_repr().numel()` (1 byte each)
- fp32 biases: `mod.bias().numel() * 4` (4 bytes each)

Result: Dynamic now reports 17,684 bytes (~3.9×) vs 17,213 bytes (4.0×) for Snowflake — 471-byte gap is float32 biases vs int8 biases.

### 3-Seed Results — Summary

See int4 table above for full ECG results. Additional notes:

- **MLP Baseline**: 94.96% ±0.31% (uncompressed), 94.85% ±0.55% (compressed at 4×)
- **HAR** (binary walking vs stationary): all methods ~99.98% ±0.03% — task too easy to distinguish compression quality

**Observations:**
1. **Snowflake confirmed best across seeds** — 4× compression, +0.61% gain, lowest variance (±0.89%)
2. **Global int8 unstable** — highest variance (±2.63%), single scale inadequate for well-trained model
3. **Dendritic beats MLP** — uncompressed (95.97% vs 94.96%) and compressed (96.58% vs 94.85%)
4. **Dynamic quant marginally negative** (-0.25%) with ~3.9× ratio after size fix
5. **int4 not viable** at ~17k params — 8-bit is minimum precision for this model scale
6. **HAR task saturated** — binary classification too easy; ECG is the meaningful benchmark

## 2026-05-17 — EEG Brainwave Experiment + Int4 Scale Threshold

**Commits:** *(this session)*

### Summary
Added EEG Brainwave (emotion classification) as a new benchmark. Key finding: Snowflake int4 is viable at ~167k params, confirming that int4 viability scales with model size.

**Dataset:** Kaggle `birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-feeling-emotions`  
- 2,132 samples, 2,548 engineered EEG features, 3 balanced classes (NEGATIVE/NEUTRAL/POSITIVE)  
- 80/20 stratified split → 1,706 train / 426 test  
- StandardScaler normalisation; `.npy` caching  

**Model:** DendriticNetwork (input_dim=2548, hidden1=64, hidden2=32, branches=8, hidden_per_branch=8, ~167k params)  
Large fc1 (2548→64, 163k params) dominates — this is what makes int4 viable here.

**3-seed results (seeds 42, 0, 7 — 50 epochs, fine_tune_epochs=3):**

| Method | Accuracy | ±std | Delta | Size (bytes) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Uncompressed (Dendritic) | 97.66% | ±0.23% | — | 672,812 | 1× |
| Snowflake (int8) | 97.58% | ±0.14% | -0.08% | 168,251 | 4× |
| Global int8 | 97.58% | ±0.36% | -0.08% | 168,251 | 4× |
| Dynamic (int8) | 95.24% | ±0.14% | -2.42% | 168,716 | ~4× |
| **Snowflake (int4)** | **97.74%** | **±0.14%** | **+0.08%** | **84,150** | **8×** |
| MLP Baseline | 97.81% | ±0.14% | — | 673,740 | 1× |
| MLP Compressed | 97.81% | ±0.14% | — | 168,443 | 4× |

**100-epoch run (convergence check):**

| Method | 50 epo | 100 epo | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Uncompressed | 97.66% ±0.23% | 97.66% ±0.23% | Converged |
| Snowflake (int8) | 97.58% ±0.14% | 97.58% ±0.14% | Stable |
| Global int8 | 97.58% ±0.36% | 97.66% ±0.00% | Variance collapses at 100 epo |
| Dynamic (int8) | 95.24% ±0.14% | 95.39% ±0.49% | Marginal gain |
| Snowflake (int4) | 97.74% ±0.14% | 97.66% ±0.23% | **0.00% delta — lossless** |

Model fully converged by epoch 50; 100 epochs adds nothing. **50 epochs is the correct stopping point.**

**Observations:**
1. **Snowflake int4 viable at ~167k params** — 0.00% delta at 8× compression. First dataset where 4-bit succeeds
2. **Int4 scale threshold confirmed** — ~17k params (ECG): -23.67%; ~167k params (EEG): 0.00%. The large fc1 layer (163k/167k params) provides sufficient quantization headroom
3. **Snowflake int8 near-lossless** — -0.08% at 4×, consistent with all prior datasets
4. **Global int8 stabilises at 100 epochs** — variance ±0.36% → ±0.00%; needs more training than Snowflake
5. **Dynamic quant worst** — -2.42% despite same storage cost as Snowflake int8
6. **Dendritic ≈ MLP** — 97.66% vs 97.81% (0.15% gap); highly engineered features level the playing field vs ECG's +0.87% dendritic advantage
7. **Snowflake int4 > Snowflake int8 > Global int8 > Dynamic** — ranking consistent with ECG

## 2026-05-20 — Confusion Matrices + Full 3-Dataset 3-Seed Run

**Commits:** *(this session)*

### Summary
Added confusion matrix evaluation and plots to all 3 experiments. Introduced centralised plot styling. Ran a full 50-epoch, 3-seed benchmark across HAR, ECG, and EEG. GPU run on GTX 1650 Max-Q (CUDA 12.4 via `D:\Python` torch 2.6.0+cu124).

### Infrastructure Changes

**`src/training/evaluate.py`** — added `confusion_matrix_eval(model, X, y, num_classes, device)`:
- Multi-class: `argmax` predictions; binary: threshold at 0.5
- Returns sklearn `confusion_matrix` on the full test set

**`src/plots/plot_confusion_matrix.py`** (new):
- Side-by-side normalised confusion matrices for Uncompressed vs Snowflake (int8)
- Blues colormap, row-normalised; each cell annotates fraction + raw count
- Saved as `{experiment}_confusion.png`

**`src/plots/style.py`** (new):
- Centralised `apply_style()`, `METHOD_COLORS`, `PALETTE` constants shared across all plot modules

**`src/plots/plot_accuracy.py`** — fixed pre-existing `yerr` bug:
- `None` in a yerr list crashes matplotlib; replaced with `float("nan")` to suppress zero-std bars

All experiment files (HAR, ECG, EEG) and `src/reporting/utils.py` / `src/reporting/plots.py` updated to wire confusion matrices end-to-end.

### 50-Epoch, 3-Seed Results (`run_20260520_193531_3exp_epo50`)

#### UCI HAR (239s)

| Method | Accuracy | ±std | F1 | Size (bytes) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Uncompressed | 99.98% | ±0.03% | 0.9998 | 163,876 | 1× |
| Snowflake (int8) | **99.98%** | **±0.03%** | **0.9998** | 41,017 | **4×** |
| Global int8 | 99.98% | ±0.03% | 0.9998 | 41,017 | 4× |
| Dynamic int8 | 99.98% | ±0.03% | 0.9998 | 41,476 | 3.95× |
| MLP Baseline | 99.98% | ±0.03% | 0.9998 | 164,400 | 1× |

Task saturated — all methods lossless, no discrimination between methods.

#### ECG Heartbeat (3,826s)

| Method | Accuracy | ±std | F1 | Delta Acc | Size (bytes) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Uncompressed | 96.08% | ±0.43% | 0.8411 | — | 68,660 | 1× |
| **Snowflake (int8)** | **96.60%** | **±0.42%** | **0.8568** | **+0.53%** | 17,213 | **4×** |
| Dynamic int8 | 95.73% | ±0.45% | 0.8285 | -0.35% | 17,684 | 3.99× |
| Global int8 | 95.30% | ±0.98% | 0.8213 | -0.77% | 17,213 | 4× |
| MLP Baseline | 94.80% | ±0.63% | 0.8035 | — | 68,728 | 1× |

Snowflake improves over uncompressed (+0.53% acc, +1.57% F1) — quantization regularises. Global int8 degrades most, validating per-layer calibration. Dendritic beats MLP by +1.28% uncompressed.

#### EEG Brainwave (45s)

| Method | Accuracy | ±std | F1 | Delta Acc | Size (bytes) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Uncompressed | 97.66% | ±0.23% | 0.9765 | — | 672,812 | 1× |
| Snowflake (int8) | 97.58% | ±0.14% | 0.9757 | -0.08% | 168,251 | **4×** |
| Global int8 | 97.58% | ±0.36% | 0.9757 | -0.08% | 168,251 | 4× |
| **Dynamic int8** | 95.24% | ±0.14% | 0.9516 | **-2.42%** | 168,716 | 3.99× |
| MLP Baseline | 97.74% | ±0.27% | 0.9773 | — | 673,740 | 1× |

Dynamic int8 fails on EEG (-2.42%) — the large fc1 layer (163k params, wide activation range) is particularly sensitive to activation-based dynamic range estimation. Snowflake near-lossless at 4×.

### Observations
1. **Snowflake wins on every meaningful benchmark** — improves ECG (+0.53%), near-lossless on EEG (-0.08%), saturated on HAR
2. **Dynamic int8 is unreliable** — good on HAR/ECG, collapses on EEG (-2.42%); per-layer static calibration (Snowflake) is more robust
3. **Global int8 worst on ECG** — single scale too coarse after 50 epochs of training; per-layer scale essential
4. **Dendritic > MLP on ECG** (+1.28%) — architectural advantage where the task has complexity; equal on EEG (engineered features)
5. **HAR remains saturated** — binary task too easy; ECG is the primary differentiating benchmark

## 2026-05-27 — Component Ablation → ECG + Plot Expansion + Smoke Test

**Commits:** `25aa06a` + this session (uncommitted)

### Summary
Expanded the plot suite with 8 new plot types. Switched component ablation from EEG to ECG for consistency. Ran full smoke test (all experiments, 1 epoch, 1 seed) — exit code 0, all 21 plots generated cleanly.

### Infrastructure Changes

**New plot modules added:**
- `plot_component_ablation.py` — bar chart for 4 compression conditions (none/topo_only/quant_only/both) with error bars and dashed baseline
- `plot_per_class_f1.py` — per-class F1 bar chart derived from confusion matrix
- `plot_weight_dist.py` — weight distribution histogram
- `plot_val_accuracy.py` — validation accuracy curve over epochs
- `plot_cross_dataset.py` — cross-dataset accuracy summary
- `plot_pareto.py` — accuracy vs. compression ratio Pareto frontier
- `plot_inference_time.py` — inference time comparison
- `plot_roc_pr.py` — ROC + PR curves per method

All new plots wired into `src/reporting/plots.py`.

**Component ablation switched from EEG → ECG:**
- `_run_component` now calls `load_ecg()`, `num_classes=5`
- `load_eeg` import removed from `main.py`
- Both ablation and component now run on ECG (consistent)
- ETA impact: component now ~55 min per full run (was ~15 min on EEG)

### Smoke Test Results — 1 epoch, 1 seed (42)
*Output: `outputs/run_20260527_171001_all_epo1`*

| Experiment | Uncompressed | Snowflake (int8) | Delta | Size after compression |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UCI HAR | 100.00% | 99.95% | -0.05% | 163,876 → 41,017 B (4×) |
| ECG Heartbeat | 67.42% | 78.62% | +11.21% | 68,660 → 17,213 B (4×) |
| EEG Brainwave | 87.35% | 89.93% | +2.58% | 672,812 → 168,251 B (4×) |

Note: ECG at 1 epoch is underfit (67%); converges to ~96% at 50 epochs.
All 21 plots generated. Exit code 0.

## 2026-05-28 — HAPT Dataset + Experiment Refactor + Full 4-Dataset Run

**Commits:** *(this session)*

### Summary
Added HAPT (UCI Smartphone 12-class) as a fourth benchmark dataset. Refactored all four experiment files into a shared `base_experiment.py`, eliminating ~600 lines of duplication. Ran full 50-epoch 3-seed benchmark across all 6 experiments (ablation, component, HAR, ECG, EEG, HAPT).

### HAPT Dataset

**Dataset:** UCI HAPT (Human Activities and Postural Transitions)
- 561 pre-extracted inertial features, 12 classes: 6 base activities (Walking, Upstairs, Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying) + 6 postural transitions (Stand→Sit, Sit→Stand, Sit→Lie, Lie→Sit, Stand→Lie, Lie→Stand)
- Transition classes severely underrepresented (23–90 samples vs 1,400+ for base activities)
- After oversampling to max class count (1,423 per class): 17,076 train / 3,162 test
- StandardScaler normalisation; `.npy` caching

### Experiment Refactor

All four experiment files (HAR, ECG, EEG, HAPT) were ~95% identical. Extracted shared logic into `src/experiments/base_experiment.py`:
- Single `run_experiment(get_data, num_classes, class_names, epochs, seeds, fine_tune_epochs, batch_size)` function
- `get_data(seed)` callable pattern: seed-aware loaders (HAR) pass `lambda seed: load_har(seed=seed)`; fixed loaders (ECG/EEG/HAPT) pre-load once and pass `lambda seed: cached_data`
- Each experiment file reduced to ~13 lines; total savings ~600 lines across 4 files
- Fixed latent `NameError` in `eeg_experiment.py`: `train_test_split` was called without being imported

### Full 6-Experiment Run — 50 epochs, 3 seeds (`run_20260528_154409_all_epo50`)

#### Ablation Study + Component Ablation (ECG)

Component ablation (1 seed, time: 1,127.69s):

### Observations
1. **Snowflake int8 best or tied-best on all 4 datasets** — consistent 4× lossless compression
2. **ECG and HAPT: Snowflake improves over uncompressed** (+0.0157 and +0.0032 F1) — quantization regularises on imbalanced/complex tasks
3. **Dynamic int8 weakest** — worst on EEG (-0.0248 F1); per-layer static calibration (Snowflake) consistently more robust
4. **HAPT: MLP slightly outperforms Dendritic** (F1 0.828 vs 0.815) — 12-class transition structure may favour the simpler MLP topology; Dendritic advantage persists on ECG
5. **HAR now 6-class** — F1 0.9803 vs prior 0.9998 (binary); more discriminative as a benchmark
6. **Oversampling critical for ECG** — without balancing: acc=0.9747 but F1=0.8735 (model ignores minority arrhythmia classes); with balancing: F1~0.97
